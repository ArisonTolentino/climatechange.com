        <p>
            Around at the middle of the 1800s and during the industrial revolution was <br> 
            the start of a global crisis. Physicist John Tyndall recognized Earth's natural <br>
             greenhouse effect and suggested that slight changes in the atmospheric composition <br>
              could bring about climatic variations. In 1896, a Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius was <br> 
              the first to predict that changes in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could substantially <br>
               alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. By the late 1950s, CO2 readings would <br>
                give some of the first data to confirm the global warming theory. The UN says that our world is hotter <br>
                 by 1C since pre-industrial times and it is okay, in fact the UN says if we reach 1.5C by the end of the <br>
                  century we would be fine and even 2C, but CO2 level keeps rising faster and faster and this could mean catastrophe <br> 
                  since the temperature of Earth is about to reach 1.5C in only just 10 years.</p><br><br>

                  <p>
                    Climate change is not only hurting us but it is also hurting animals, plants, <br> 
                    and Earth. Human activities is the cause of the crisis and as we keep burning fossil <br>
                     fuels, coals, oils, and gasses, it will produce more CO2 therefore climate change and <br> 
                     global warming will keep getting worse. Our planet keeps getting warmer because the greenhouse <br>
                      gasses in the atmosphere prevent some of the heat from returning directly to space, this is <br>
                       the Greenhouse effect. Deforastation is happening since trees are being burned down, sea levels are <br> 
                       rising because of the icebergs melting. Climate change can be slowed down if we work together and act together. <br> 
                       We can slow it down by reducing the use of cars and instead use bikes or walk. We need more people to be informed <br>
                        about this so we could potentially save our world and have a future to look forward into.</p><br><br>
